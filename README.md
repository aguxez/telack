# telack
Telegram - Slack webhook system.

Telack is a simple relay between Slack and Telegram. Instructions are in the documents, just get it up and running and you're good to go;
start sending messages between your Slack team and Telegram group (Because talking just with the bot isn't really brilliant, right?)

P.S. Telack is the original name of the project, remember that you can change the name of your incoming webhook in Slack's settings; same thing with Telegram :)
